# CSC
The Cell Segmentation and Counting based on Gray Lvel Clustering (CSC) package.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The detection of Anti-Nuclear Autoantibodies (ANA) and cytoplasmic components plays an important role in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. The analysis of images obtained by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) tecnique, applied on Human Epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells, is the best practice for the detection of autoantibodies. This package offers a powerful tool for automatic cell segmentation and counting.
